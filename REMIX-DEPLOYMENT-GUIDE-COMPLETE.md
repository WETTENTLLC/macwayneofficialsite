## 🛠️ Detailed Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup
1. **Install MetaMask** if not already installed
2. **Fund your wallet** with ETH for gas fees
3. **Select correct network** in MetaMask
4. **Test connection** by checking your address in Remix

### Step 2: Contract Preparation
1. **Copy contract code** from `MacWayneBatteredCoin.sol`
2. **Verify wallet addresses** are correct format (0x + 40 hex characters)
3. **Double-check addresses** - these cannot be changed easily after deployment

### Step 3: Compilation Verification
```solidity
// Your contract should show these in Remix:
✅ Compilation successful
✅ No errors
✅ No warnings
✅ Green checkmark visible
```

### Step 4: Deployment Execution
1. **Select Environment**: "Injected Provider - MetaMask"
2. **Verify Account**: Your deployer address should appear
3. **Check Gas Limit**: Should be around 1,200,000
4. **Enter Constructor Parameters**:
   ```
   _accessibilityFundWallet: "0x..." (paste your accessibility wallet)
   _macWayneWallet: "0x..." (paste your Mac Wayne wallet)
   ```
5. **Click Deploy**
6. **Confirm in MetaMask**
7. **Wait for confirmation**

### Step 5: Verify Deployment
After successful deployment, you should see:
- ✅ Contract address generated
- ✅ Contract appears in "Deployed Contracts" section
- ✅ All functions visible and callable

## ✅ Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate Checks
Run these functions in Remix to verify deployment:

```javascript
// Basic Properties
name() → "Mac Wayne Battered Coin"
symbol() → "MWB"  
decimals() → 18
totalSupply() → 1000000000000000000000000

// Addresses
owner() → Your deployer address
accessibilityFundWallet() → Your accessibility fund address
macWayneWallet() → Your Mac Wayne fund address

// Balances
balanceOf(YOUR_ADDRESS) → 1000000000000000000000000 (full supply)

// Settings
purchaseLimitsEnabled() → true
maxPurchasePerAddress() → 10000000000000000000000 (10K tokens)
```

### Fee System Test
1. **Transfer small amount** to test address
2. **Verify recipient** receives 83% of transfer (100% - 17% fees)
3. **Check fund wallets** receive 15% and 2% respectively
