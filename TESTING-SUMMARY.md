# Mac Wayne Site Testing Strategy & Findings

## Testing Strategy Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Mac Wayne site before deployment to GitHub Pages. The testing is organized into four key areas:

1. **Site Functionality** - Testing general navigation, forms, links, and non-payment features
2. **Payment Features** - Testing purchase system, donation functionality, and checkout process
3. **Audio Playback** - Testing 30-second preview clips and audio player functionality
4. **Live Features & User Assistance** - Testing interactive experiences and user support systems

## Testing Documentation

We have created the following testing resources:

1. **FINAL-TESTING-CHECKLIST.md** - A comprehensive checklist covering all aspects of the site
2. **BROWSER-COMPATIBILITY-GUIDE.md** - Detailed instructions for cross-browser testing
3. **AUDIO-PLAYBACK-TESTING-GUIDE.md** - In-depth guide for testing the audio player functionality
4. **PAYMENT-TESTING-GUIDE.md** - Detailed guide for testing payment and donation features
5. **run-automated-tests.ps1** - PowerShell script for automated testing of basic functionality

## Initial Automated Test Results

We ran initial automated tests on the site, and the findings are summarized below:

### Core Files Verification
- ‚úÖ All core HTML files exist (index.html, shop.html, battered-coin.html)
- ‚úÖ All JavaScript files exist (audio-player.js, shop.js, battered-coin.js)
- ‚úÖ CSS files exist (components.css)

### HTML Structure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è HTML structure validation warnings detected in all pages
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing HEAD and BODY section tags (may be a regex detection issue)
- üîç Needs manual verification of actual HTML structure

### JavaScript Validation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential issues found in audio-player.js
- ‚úÖ No obvious syntax errors in shop.js
- ‚úÖ No obvious syntax errors in battered-coin.js

### Content Validation
- ‚úÖ All pages have correct titles

### Resource Verification
- ‚ùå Audio directory not found or not accessible

### Link Validation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Several broken internal links detected
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing favicon.ico
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some anchor links may not be properly implemented (#music, #tour, #contact)

## Critical Issues to Address

Based on the automated testing, these critical issues should be addressed before deployment:

1. **Audio Resources** - Ensure audio files are properly organized and accessible
2. **Broken Links** - Fix internal navigation links
3. **Favicon** - Add missing favicon.ico file or update references
4. **HTML Structure** - Verify correct HTML structure in all pages
5. **JavaScript Issues** - Resolve potential issues in audio-player.js

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Manual Testing Priority**:
   - Audio player functionality across browsers
   - Payment/donation system with various payment methods
   - Mobile responsiveness of all features

2. **Browser Testing Priority**:
   - Chrome (desktop and mobile)
   - Safari (iOS)
   - Firefox (desktop)
   - Edge (desktop)

3. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Color contrast

## Next Steps

1. Follow the comprehensive **FINAL-TESTING-CHECKLIST.md** to perform systematic testing
2. Use the browser compatibility guide to test across multiple browsers
3. Focus detailed testing on audio player functionality
4. Test payment and donation systems thoroughly
5. Document all issues found for resolution before final deployment
