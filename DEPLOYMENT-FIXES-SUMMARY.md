## Next Steps

1. **Final Testing:**
   - Test all anchor links to ensure they navigate to the correct sections
   - Test audio player functionality with the new error handling
   - Verify all internal links work correctly
   - Test site on multiple browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility

2. **Note on Automated Test Warnings:**
   - The automated testing script shows warnings about HTML structure validation (missing HEAD and BODY sections), but these appear to be false positives as we've verified the HTML files contain proper HEAD and BODY tags.
   - The script also shows warnings about broken links to index.html#faq, index.html#privacy, and index.html#terms which are secondary navigation items that can be addressed in a future update if needed.
   - The warning about audio-player.js issues should be resolved with our fixes, but should be manually verified.

3. **Deployment to GitHub Pages:**
   - Follow the deployment procedures outlined in DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md
   - Verify deployed site functionality after deployment

3. **Post-Deployment Verification:**
   - Run through PRE-DEPLOYMENT-VERIFICATION.md checklist on the deployed site
   - Verify all functionality works correctly in the live environment
