# MacWayneBatteredCoin Contract Optimization

## Issues Fixed

The following issues have been fixed in the MacWayneBatteredCoin contract:

### 1. Infinite Gas Requirement Errors

The following functions were previously reporting infinite gas requirements:
- `name()`
- `symbol()`
- `allowance()`
- `transfer()`
- `transferFrom()`

**Solution:**
- Properly implemented the IERC20 interface
- Changed string state variables to pure function returns
- Added `override` modifiers to interface implementation functions
- Switched from `external` to `public` visibility where needed

### 2. Variable Shadowing

- Parameter `owner` in the `allowance` function was shadowing the contract's state variable
- Fixed by renaming the parameter to `tokenOwner`

### 3. Gas Optimization

- Added `unchecked` blocks for arithmetic operations that cannot overflow
- Removed redundant event declarations 
- Optimized the fee calculation logic

### 4. Guard Conditions

- Used `require()` for input validation which is the correct approach for user inputs
- Retained overflow protection via Solidity 0.8.0's built-in overflow checking

## Testing

The contract now compiles successfully with no warnings or errors. The following tests were performed:
- Compilation with Solidity compiler 0.8.x
- Binary size verification
- Code validation

## Deployment

The contract is now ready for deployment. 15% of each transaction will be automatically sent to the accessibility fund wallet as specified in the contract design.
